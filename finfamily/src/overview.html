<h1>FinFamily </h1>

<p>Swing-based java-application for managing genealogical data.</p>
  <p>The genealogical data is stored in a PostgreSQL database</p>
  
  <p>The main class for the swing application is {@link fi.kaila.suku.swing.Suku Swing entry}.</p>
  <p>The main class for the webstart application is {@link fi.kaila.suku.webstart.Suku Webstart entry}.</p>
  
  <h2>Architecture</h2>
  
  <p>The application architecture consists of following main components:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>User interface consisting of swing displays</li> 
  <li>A Kontroller that connects the User interface to the server application</li>
  <li>Server application that manages the <strong>PostrgreSQL</strong> database.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>FinFamily requires Java 6SE and the PostgreSQL database. At least Windows and Linux 
  systems support these. Possibly the application can be used on a Mac computer.</p>
  
   
   <p>PostgreSQL is a <strong>real</strong> database. It is the most advanced open source
   relational database available. Both Java and PostgreSQL are free and makes the application
   affordable. Both have easy to use installation procedures but the installation of these
   may require the support of an IT professional.</p>
   
   <h2>Flavours</h2>
   
   <ul>
   <li>Local use. Both userinterface and database are installed on 
   same workstation. (default)</li>
   <li>Client-Server use. Application is installed on the local workstation
   and PostgreSQL database is installed on a database located in teh same network.</li>
   <li>WebStart use. Application and server are installed as webstart application 
   on the webserver on e.g. tomcat application server. Application is started from
   browser and uses the JNLP protocol between user and server.</li>
   </ul>
