<p>The Finfamily database is located on a PostgreSQL server that usually is located on your own workstation. Your own workstation recognizes the network name <strong>localhost</strong>. A PostgreSQL server can contain several genealogy databases. Possibly other databases too. One genealogy database requires one postgres database and you should not have other data in the same database.</p>

<p>When you installed your PostgreSQL database you specified the postgres user (admin user) password. This is how you can
create a user and database on your local server:</p>

<p>Start FinFamily. (Started from Suku.exe). When program asks for login information press <strong>Cancel</strong> if you have not yet created your database.</p>

<p>Start the admin tool using command File - Database admin. The program asks for the postgres user password.</p>

<p>In above case you see a user and a few databases. First time both are empty.</p>

<p>With the command Database - Create new user you create your application userid and password. If you have forgotten your password for your user you can change it here also.</p>

<p><image src="adminuser.jpg" border="0" title="Admin dialog" alt="java ok"/></p> 

 
<p>use the command database - Create new database when you want to create a new database. The command Drop database removes the database and all data from it.</p>

<p>Exit admin tool using command Database - Exit.</p>
